## Project Overview

The J-PARC muon g-2 experiment aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon by detecting positrons produced from muon decay.
This repository contains the code to simulate positron trajectories in the presence of a magnetic field, based on the experiment's detector geometry.

### Key Features:
- Generation of synthetic positron tracks based on helical trajectory models.
- Detector geometry consists of 40 radially arranged vanes with coverage from 90 mm to 290 mm in the radial direction and ±200 mm in height.
- Positron trajectory modeling includes the influence of a 3 T magnetic field and momentum in the range of 30–290 MeV/c.
- Simulation includes timestamping of hits on the detector with a 5 ns time resolution.
- Data generated in Excel format, including hit points and time stamps.

### Functions
- Code contains different functions which can be used to model the trajctory and noise levels.
